1 ) In the second step of pdf, we need to place order. For playing order use format
`item_name full/half quantity` and keep on entering as many enteries in this format you want to order. For example: `1 full 2 2 half 4` implies customer have order Item 1 full plate 2 times and Item 2 half plate 4 times.
