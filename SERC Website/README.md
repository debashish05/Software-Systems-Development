## Assignment - 2(b): SERC Website

1 ) For admin mode there is a button on top right part "Switch to Admin Mode". After clicking that, all the html parts are directly editable (I have used javascript: document.body.contentEditable = true;). The changes are not persitent and go away with a reload but it can change any text in the webpage.  

2.a) About the center and focus area can be directly navigated through clicking in nav bar or scrolling down the page.

2.b) Student,factulty and Alumni can be viewed by clicking through navbar at "PEOPLE" tabs and then selecting appropriate sections. When one hover over the image we can see there Research areas, About Me and Link to there profiles.

2.c) Contact can form can be viewed by going through the navbar or scrolling at the end of the page. 

3) I am only displaying Prof "Raghu Reddy" publication sorted by year through iframe. So it will work dynamically. 

4.a) News/updates is provided in the right side of About section. It can be statically modified.   
4.b) At the end of the page after contact section there are favicons for Twitter, Facebook and Linkedin which will redirect into SERC hande in new tabs.

I have used free template in development of this website.
