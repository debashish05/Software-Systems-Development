        <p id="desc">International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (commonly abbreviated as IIIT Hyderabad or
            simply IIIT-H) is a deemed university located in Hyderabad, Telangana, established in 1998 under a
            Not-for-Profit Public Private Partnership, laying focus on Information Technology and other fields such as
            Computer Science, Electronics and Communication, Computer Aided Structural Engineering and their
            interdisciplinary applications across other domains. In 1998, IIIT Hyderabad was the first of the
            International Institutes of Information Technology to be established in India.

            The institute counts around 1800 students and over 85 faculty members. Known for its narrow and deep
            focus on computer science, IIIT Hyderabad is divided into various research centres and labs, as opposed
            to schools and departments. The institute is ranked amongst the top research universities in the
            country, computed based on publications in CS-related areas.

            IIIT Hyderabad is widely popular for its coding culture, with students frequently making it to the ACM ICPC
            World Finals. The admission to the single-degree (B-Tech) programs is done through the Joint
            Entrance Examination. Admission for the dual-degree programs is done through the institute's own
            research-oriented examination and olympiads such as the International Olympiad on Informatics (IOI).
